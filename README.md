# HR_WEBAPP
This program is designed to track a few things:
- Roster of employees
- Employee Holidays
- Employee Flights
- General HR Dashboard

This program has a login screen so each employee can log in an see only what they should have access to.
The first time the user logs in they will be required to accept the terms and conditions, and change their password. This can be reset by IT in the admin panel.

This program needs a database set up (look in the code to figure out how to set it out)

The program will not work without being edited first!

THIS PROGRAM IS NOT INTENDED FOR GENERAL USE


This program was designed and made by Adam Keith.

AI was used to help write code faster but was prompted in detail and taught using code written by Adam Keith. (E.g. Here is my code, only change this word to something else)


Some libraries were used to create this program, these are the general ones like: JQuery, Moment, fullcalender etc.
